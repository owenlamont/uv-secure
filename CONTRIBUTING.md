# Contributing to uv-secure

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **uv-secure**! This document outlines the
guidelines for contributing to ensure a smooth collaboration experience. I'd love to get
more contributors, even for small changes like documentation fixes, examples, or
additional tests, partly just because I know a lot of people won't adopt uv-secure if
they don't see multiple contributors.

## Code Style and Testing

Refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for machine (but still relevant to human) code style and
testing guidelines.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/owenlamont/uv-secure/issues) on GitHub. Include as
much detail as possible to help reproduce the issue or understand the feature request (
providing any problem pylock.toml, requirements.txt, or uv.lock files would help).

Thank you for helping improve uv-secure!
